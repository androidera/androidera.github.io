# Android Era with Kotlin and Java Template

This is the Android Era with Kotlin and Java Template source which we're trying to show the chatroom rules to new comers.

You can see the hosted rules in : [**Androidera.github.io**](https://androidera.github.io)

# For Contributers

There are just two files, `Default.html` and `index.md` if you wanted to make some changes, `index.md` contains the whole body content, And the `Default.html` conatins the all page codes.

# Notes

I've used the [**cayman**](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman) default Github Theme and customized it for our chatroom rules. The `default.html` codes for *cayman* template are here : [default.html](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman/blob/master/_layouts/default.html)
